    "What we saw above is true for all partitions, but in this section we examine only particular kinds of partitions. When an underlying set of a topological space is endowed with an operator such that it satisfies the group axioms, we end up with a structure that is called a ***topological group***. The remarkable thing about these groups is that we can now apply all group theoretic properties to our topological contexts."
